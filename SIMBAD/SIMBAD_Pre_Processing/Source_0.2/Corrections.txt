This new version 0.2 of the SIMBAD pre-processing program includes the folowing corrections and modifications:
* Definition of minimum threshold values for added masses and radiation dampings
* Hydrostatic coefficient values other than C33,C35,C44,C53,C55 put to zero (due to ship's lateral symmetry)
* Better determination of the simulated wave spectrum according to the Welch's method
* Correction of a bug in the determination of the wave spectrum with the Fast method (spectrum shifted to the left resulting in a higher peak period for the simulated spectrum)
* Calculation of significant wave height, frequency moments, maximum wave height and peak period (corresponding to the maximum in the wave spectrum) of the simulated wave time series
